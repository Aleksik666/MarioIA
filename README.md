# Mario IA
This is a collection of machine learning scripts that plays the first level of Super Mario Bros.
## What do you need to run it:
- [BizHawk Emulator](http://tasvideos.org/BizHawk.html)
- The Super Mario Bros. ROM for the SNES
- A saved state file of the beginning of the first level (you can make one with BizHawk)
## Script List
### Neural Network
Each frame, calculates if Mario needs to jump based on this [Neural Network Schema](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1naWKAq85frg-lAz8pJx-DmbHNdsVH-zuW3Zrsco-CVw/edit?usp=sharing)
### Genetic Algorithm
Finds the correct jump sequence with a Genetic Algorithm
### Random with Memory
Plays randomly, remembering the moves until some seconds before Mario's Death
